# Fraud-detection-with-Scikit-learn
Using Scikit-learn to detect fraudulent transactions through Logistic Regression techniques. The dataset used is available at the following [Kaggle URL](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/). You can also see this in action in the following [Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nBH-6mJ3SjSKFJagth0f6oyJLhHeZ_6-) or check the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/cristianlopezcano/Fraud-detection-with-Scikit-learn/blob/master/Fraud_detection.ipynb) in this repository.

Unlike actual regression, logistic regression does not try to predict the value of a numeric variable given a set of inputs. Instead, the output is a **probability** that the given input point belongs to a certain class. In this case with two classes, `Fraudulent transaction` and `Legitimate transaction`, we assume that the data space can be cleanly and **linearly** separated into two regions based on the features given in the dataset. The logistic regression model tries to find those two regions and can classify future occurrences based on where they are located in the space.
